*I wanted to share a little bit about the process for adding students to teams, and then get everybody's thoughts.*

Each school or organization on EduGuide.org gets its own team. The only way that someone can join a team is if they have been given a join code or sent an invitation. This ensures that each team is private, and also limits membership on the site to those who have been pre-approved.

# Team Role Structure

Within a team, users can be assigned the role of coach or member. Typically, coaches will join via invitation, and students will join using either a special URL or a join code.

## Coaches

### Coach Levels

There are multiple levels of coaches on the team: Admin Coaches, Lead Coaches, and Support Coaches. These can be thought of as being the equivalent of group owners, administrators, and moderators in other community systems. Typically, an Admin coach will be two or three individuals who are managing the rest of the coaches on the team, and teachers are lead coaches, while anybody in a supporting role will serve as a support coach. The way a school uses the different coach levels really depends on how their own staff is structured.

The different level of coaches have differing capabilities on the site. Admin Coaches can invite other coaches, delete groups, etc. Lead coaches have a few capabilities, and support coaches are the most limited. All coaches are able to monitor students' path progress and respond in their activities.

One final level for coaches is the Team Captain. Usually a team will have one person who is leading everybody else. Admin coaches can promote and designate other coaches as team captains from the Invite Coaches page within the team.

### Coach Features

Coaches are able to access their personal dashboard, their school's team, the metrics page, group management, member management, a personal path, and the comments inside each individual student's’ path. They will also receive weekly and daily reports on path progress.

## Students

When students join the site, they are listed as members of the site and the team, but they are restricted to specific parts of the site. Unlike coaches, students are only able to access their personal dashboard, personal settings, and their personal path.

# Adding Students and Coaches

Sometimes, there is confusion over how the invitation works for students and coaches. There are a lot of concepts on the site such as teams, groups, and paths. It is easiest to think of membership on the site as broken down in this way:

1. Site

    1. Team

        1. Group

        2. Path Subscription

This diagram shows that as a student joins the site using a join code, they are automatically added to the team AND group which is associated with that code. The code only adds them to one group, but later on they can easily be changed from one group to another, or removed from a group.

Path subscriptions differ depending on the team that the coach or student is joining.

## Inviting Coaches

Admin coaches are able to send invitations to others who they would like to join the team as a coach. The page is accessible from the team's main navigation menu.

If you are an admin coach, click on the gear icon in the team's navigation menu. Next, click "Coaches." You will be taken to the page where you can enter in the email addresses for the people you would like to invite as coaches.

After you submit the new email address, an invitation is sent out containing instructions for how the person you invited can join your team. They will be prompted for their registration information, then taken into their professional development path.

## Inviting Students

Students will typically join by going to the address [http://join.eduguide.org](http://join.eduguide.org) and including a join code on their form when they register on the site.

First, they will be asked if they would like to log into an existing account, or if they need to create a new account. Students usually will want to start a new account.

The last field on the form, labeled invitation code, is where they would enter in the join code for the team.

#### Obtaining the join code for your group

There are two ways to locate the join code for your group. We will typically post documents in the library which contain the code. Or, you can look up your group's join code from inside the metrics area.

To locate the join code for your group, first use the site menus to navigate to your team's group management page. You can use the site wide menu next to the logo if you’re viewing your team, or you can use the side menu if you are on the metrics page or working on your path.

From the menu, click on "Team Groups." You will be taken to the group management page. Next, locate the group that you would like to add students to.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/yQhQTEXsaX07WW4WjbUU6w_img_6.png)

On the Group Management page, the list of groups will be broken up into three sections: Pending Groups, My Groups, and Other Groups. If you just created the group that you're looking for, it would be listed under Pending. If it is a group that you are already following it will be listed under "My Groups."

When the autogroup feature is turned on, groups are automatically created for coaches as they join the site. So, a group might already be available for you by the time you are ready to add your students, even if you didn't manually create a group. You can look for a group which has your name in its title. If you’re not sure if autogroups are turned on, check with an admin coach or feel free to contact the EduGuide helpdesk at [web@eduguide.org](mailto:web@eduguide.org).

You can also use the filter and search functions located just under the grey shading to locate the group that you are looking for.

Once you've found the group that you would like to invite students to, click the button "Invite Members" to the left of its title. You will be taken to that group’s invitation code page.

The invitation page offers three ways in which you can add students to your team. The first two methods provide either a join code or a URL which you can give to students. If you're using the join code, you will want to also instruct your students to go to [http://join.eduguide.org](http://join.eduguide.org). The URL will automatically populate the field with the join code, so students will merely need to click it. Once you’ve decided which method to use, click on the "Copy" buttons underneath the appropriate square, and then you can paste the information into an email, document, or webpage which you can then distribute/share with students.

There are many ways in which you can distribute this information. When you're guiding students onto the site, you can read off the address and the join code to them verbally, or display them somewhere in your classroom so that they are easy to reference. The join URL can be distributed to students using an internal web system like moodle or a private google document. It is important that the URL is displayed as an active hyperlink so that the students are able to click it when they are ready to be taken to the site.

The last option, labeled "From List," takes you to a page where you can add existing members to that group. This is best to use if you are starting a new group and want to add students to it, or you are moving students from one group to another. A change in group membership doesn't impact the student's’ membership on the site, nor does it affect their path subscription or path progress.

It is important that when students are joining the team that they go to [http://join.eduguide.org](http://join.eduguide.org) instead of the homepage. Sometimes, students might decide to use the search engine to locate EduGuide's site, perhaps thinking that there will be a join link there. The homepage has a lot of marketing messaging and is geared towards professionals, so there isn’t a way for students to join the team.

When the students are ready to log back into the site, they can do so from the homepage or from the URL [http://login.eduguide.org](http://login.eduguide.org).

That's a quick review of the process for adding coaches and students to the team. Hopefully that this helped to make the steps a little clearer, but feel free to respond with questions if there were any parts that didn’t make sense. I’m also open to general thoughts and suggestions. You can respond inside this document or from within the group.
